The aim of the project is to effectively maintain and control a company's human resources operations from a single point. There are 3 different roles in the project. These are Site Administrator, Company Administrator and Personnel.
The site administrator continues to update his own information and company operations. It is possible to list companies, add companies, and appoint company managers.
The company manager can update his/her own information, list the personnel, add personnel, and respond to leave requests created by the personnel.
Staff can update their own information, view leave requests, and request leave. There are 3 different permission requests. These are annual leave, expense request and advance payment request. We prepared a short promotional video about our project. You can also review our project via my GitHub account.
